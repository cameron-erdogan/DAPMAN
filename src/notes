Structure of LeapBox

- Box (a box wireframe, corresponds to the bounds of Leap's InteractionBox)
- Shiny Sphere (represents palm position normalized to bounds of InteractionBox)
- Sphere shadow (projection of Shiny Sphere onto floor xz plane)

Box can be our main node we keep track of, shiny spehre and shadow can be children 


-------------------------

Basic program flow:
- when you first open program/start running, dapman is just listening for any hand
- when it detects a hand, check to see if it matches the first hand in the sequence
- if it does, start the entire serialized hand matching sequence
- (add visual feedback to this after backend part is done)
- if the code fails, tell the user and return to listening state
- if the code succeeds, transition to "unlocked" UI. Here you should be able to reset the passcode
- also if the code succeeds, send a code to unlock the door (need to research the hardware part of this again)
